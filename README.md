# ethgo-minimal

Ethgo-minimal is an SDK based on the excellent work by [ethgo](https://github.com/umbracle/ethgo) to interact with Ethereum compatible blockchains.

This SDK reduces the amount of dependencies while still providing the functionality needed to encode/decode types between golang and Ethereum as well as decoding Ethereum logs.
